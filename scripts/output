The war arose from the longrunning dispute be tween the Hutu and Tutsi groups within the Rwandan population. A 1959 - 1962 revolution had replaced the Tutsi monarchy with a Hutu led republic, forcing more than 336,000 Tutsi to seek refuge in neighbouring countries. A group of these refugees in Uganda founded the RPF which, under the leadership of Fred Rwigyema and Paul Kagame, became a battleready army by the late 1980s. The war began on 1 October 1990 when the RPF invaded northeastern Rwanda, advancing 60 km (37 mi) into the country. They suffered a major setback when Rwigyema was killed in action on the second day. The Rwandan Army, assisted by troops from France, gained the upper hand and the RPF were largely defeated by the end of October. Kagame, who had been in the United States during the inva sion, returned to take command. He withdrew troops to the Virunga Mountains for several months before attacking again. The RPF be gan a guerrilla war, which continued until mid 1992 with neither side able to gain the upper hand. A series of protests forced Rwandan President Juvnal Habyarimana to begin peace negotiations with the RPF and domestic opposition parties. Despite disruption and killings by Hutu Power, a group of extremists opposed to any deal, and a fresh RPF offensive in early 1993, the negotiations were successfully concluded with the signing of the Arusha Ac cords in August 1993. </s>
